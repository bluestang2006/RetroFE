[Project Discord](https://discord.gg/dpcsP8Hm9W) | [GitHub Wiki](https://github.com/CoinOPS-Official/RetroFE/wiki) | [Changelog](CHANGELOG.md)

RetroFE is a cross-platform desktop frontend designed for MAME cabinets and game centers, with a focus on simplicity and customization. 
This repository is actively maintained and hundreds of commits ahead of the original RetroFE project. 
It is designed for use within CoinOPS builds, bringing with it a significant increase in performance, optimisations, and available feature set. 

It's licensed under the terms of the GNU General Public License, version 3 or later (GPLv3).

## What's so special about this fork?

### Download and compile the source code
Download the source code

	git clone https://github.com/CoinOPS-Official/RetroFE.git

Open the Xcodeproj in `RetroFE/xcode` and build target

## Single Architecture Binary

### Install libraries
A binary supporting a single architecture can be built using [homebrew](https://brew.sh)

    brew install sdl2 sdl2_image sdl2_mixer sdl2_ttf gstreamer
    
### Download and compile the source code    
Download the source code

	git clone https://github.com/CoinOPS-Official/RetroFE.git

Generate your clang files

	cd retrofe
	cmake RetroFE/Source -BRetroFE/Build

Compile RetroFE

	cmake --build RetroFE/Build

#   Optional #

###   Creating a test environment

A launchable test environment can be created with the following commands 

	python Scripts\Package.py --os=windows/linux/mac --build=full

Copy your live RetroFE system to any folder of your choosing. Files can be found in `Artifacts/windows/RetroFE`

### Set $RETROFE_PATH via Environment variable 

RetroFE will load it's media and configuration files relative to where the binary file is located. This allows the build to be portable. If you want RetroFE to load your configuration from a fixed location regardless of where your install is copy your configuration there and set $RETROFE_PATH. Note this will work if you start RetroFE from the command line.

	vi ~/.bash_profile
	export RETROFE_PATH=/your/new/retrofe


### Set RETROFE_PATH via flat file 

Depending on your version of OS X the GUI will read user defined Environment variables from [another place](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/135688/setting-environment-variables-in-os-x). If you find this dificult to setup you can get around it by creating a text file in your HOME directory: /Users/<you>/.retrofe with one line no spaces: /your/new/retrofe. This will also work in Linux. RetroFE's configuration search order is 1st: ENV, Flat file, and executable location.

	echo /your/new/retrofe > ~/.retrofe

### Fix libpng iCCP warnings

The issue is with the png files that are being used with the Artwork. Libpng is pretty touchy about it. You can get rid of these messages with a handy tool called pngcrush found on sourceforge and github.

Error message:
	
	libpng warning: iCCP: known incorrect sRGB profile


Install pngcrush on Mac:    (linux use apt-get ?)
	
	brew install pngcrush


Use pngcrush to Find and repair pngs: 
	
	find /usr/local/opt/retrofe/collections -type f -iname '*.png' -exec pngcrush -ow -rem allb -reduce {} \;
